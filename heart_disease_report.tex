\section{Introduction}
In this project, our goal is to to accurately predict if a person has heart disease using a regression model with demographic information such as age and medical tests results such as serum cholesterol level. We hope our model can be used as a pre-testing tool for doctors to decide if further medical testing is necessary.\\

Throughout our analysis, we face two major challenges. The first one is to control the false negative rate (fnr) because telling a patient no further test is needed when he/she has heart disease can lead to fatal consequences and is therefore much more costly than false positives. Secondly, we need to limit to size of our model to ensure our model is realistic and interpretable for users such as doctors/patients. If our model is too large or complex, doctors would not be be able verify the model with their domain expertise and therefore the model would not trusted. However, in general, both controlling fnr and reducing model size can make it harder for the model to achieve high accuracy. Therefore, it is critical that we design our model structure and select model features intelligently to deal with these two challenges while moving toward our goal to make accurate predictions.\\

\section{Data Description}
The dataset we use was from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V attributed to four doctors: Andras Janosi, M.D (Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest co), William Steinbrunn, M.D (University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland), Matthias Pfisterer, M.D (University Hospital, Basel, Switzerlan) and Robert Detrano, M.D. (V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation). We chose this dataset because it has both demographics information (age and sex) and medical test results (chest pain type, serum cholesterol level etc.).\\


Here is summary of the 14 attributes in the dataset as follows: \\
1. age:age in years  \\
2. sex: (1 for male, 0 for female)  \\
3. cp: chest pain type (4 values)  \\
4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)  \\
5. chol: serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)  \\
6. fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)  \\
7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)  \\
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved  \\
9. exang: exercise induced angina(1 = yes; 0 = no)  \\
10. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  \\
11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment(values 0,1,2)  \\
12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy  \\
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect  \\
14: Target (response): 0=no heart disease, 1=has heart disease  \\


In this dataset, our response variable is target. Prior to performing our data
analysis, we randomly selected 0.9 of the data as our training set and 0.1 of
the data as our validation set. The rest of 0.1 data will be our test set,
which will be used in the end to assess our model's predictive prowess.  \\

\section{EDA}
First we will perform some basic EDAs using our training set. We only included
a corrolgram in our report because it provided the most information for
our project while most of other plots are not very informative. \\

From the plot, we see the features with the highest correlations with target
are oldpeak, ca, exang, slope and thalach. And we also observe
there are some highly colinear variables such as oldpeak and slope,
However, since our research question focuses on prediction,
we will not explicitly deal with this problem in this report. \\

\section{Methodology}
For this report, we decided to use a logistic regression model and
to use forward BIC method to select the most relevant explanatory variables
and the interaction terms between two explanatory variables
with training set for our final regression model.
Then, to find the optimal decision boundary,
we used our final regression model to predict the validation set
and drew a fpr vs fnr curve using the predictions.
The final decision boundary was chosen
so that false positive rate (fpr) is minimized while keeping fnr under 0.05,
which we chose to be our target fnr.\\

We chose a logistic regression model because our response variable is binary
and we chose BIC because it finds the model that maximizes the likelihood
of the data (which is closely associated with higher accuracy)
while penalizing large models, Therefore it is ideal
to deal with the second challenge to limit the model size.
We chose forward method because it would be too computationally expensive
to perform exhaustive search. Even though forward method doesn't guarantee that
we would find the best model, it still finds a model with high performance
in general and hence we believe it serves as a valid alternative to exhaustive search.
The use of fpr vs fnr plot to find decision boundary is
to deal with first challenge of controlling fnr. The reasons for our choice
to use 0.05 as fnr cutoff and to use only interactions
between two explanatory variables will be discussed in the discussion section.\\

Using BIC, we decided that the most helpful features for our final model are
exang, oldpeak, cp, ca, thal, sex, thalach, restecg, ca:thal, oldpeak:ca, cp:ca,
exang:sex, exang:oldpeak, exang:cp, ca:restecg, oldpeak:sex, cp:thalach (17 in total).
Many of the features selected by our model also appear to have a high correlation
with target in the corrolgram during EDA.\\


Then to decide on the optimal decision boundary, we used our regression model
to predict the validation set and drew a tpr vs tnr curve using the predictions:\\

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/roc.png}\\

By observing the tpr vs tnr curve, we found that the best fpr
we can achieve while controlling fnr to be under 0.05
is around 0.19 when the cutoff is 0.31. The cutoff also happens to be
the decision boundary that maximizes the overall accuracy.\\


Hence we decided that our final model would be a logistical regression model
with exang, oldpeak, cp, ca, thal, sex, thalach, restecg, ca:thal, oldpeak:ca,
cp:ca, exang:sex, exang:oldpeak, exang:cp, ca:restecg, oldpeak:sex and cp:thalach
as our features and 0.31 as the decision boundary.
We included a summary of the model in the additional work section.\\

Finally we will assess the performance of our model using the test set
and the our test set accuracy is 0.8431, fpr is 0.2885 and fnr is 0.02.


\section{Discussion}
Overall our model seems to be performing reasonable well with an overal accuracy
around 0.85 and false negative rate (fnr) under 0.02 on the test sets.
The false positive rate (fpr) is relatively high at around 0.3,
but it is to be expected because our final threshold was chosen
to be biased for fnr.
However, one can argue that 0.02 fnr is still way too high for our purpose
and even more so for 0.05, which we chose to be our target fnr for the model.
We admit that our choice is not very well justified but without further guidance
from medical professionals, choosing a relatively low control rate seems
to be the best available option.\\


During feature engineering, we only consider interaction between 2 explanatory
variables because we realized using interaction between 3 or more variables
would lead the model to overfit the training data. The model achieves a very
high test accuracy (~0.97) but the test fnr would stay at 0.06 even
with a decision boundary as small as 0.01, which we believe indicates the model
overfitted the training data and wasn't able to distinguish a portion of positive
cases in test set. \\

Since our primary focus is on prediction, we will discuss the diagnostic plots
and model interpretations in the addition work section. \\


Going forward, there are several things we can do to improve our current model.
First, we can consult medical professionals to gather feedback on our choice
of specific parameters (e.g. target fnr at 0.05) and the field-specific
criteria/statistical tests used to evaluate models in medical research.
In addition, it would be helpful to assess if there's any potential bias
in our data set (e.g. are people of color not well represented)
by gathering more demographic information and adjust our model accordingly.
Last but not the least, we can use ANOVA test to detect if colinear terms are
present in our model to improve the stability of our model for better interpretability.\\

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we believe that our model design tackles the challenges to control
fnr and model size well while maintaining a relatively high overall accuracy.
We recommend that this model should be used by medical professionals
in conjunction with their medical expertise as an indication
if more comprehensive tests are needed for people with potentially heart diseases
and doctors should refer to full model interpretation part in the additional work
section for guidance on how to interpret and use the model.\\
